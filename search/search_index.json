We explore why and how to fine-tune LLMs, the strategic importance of instruction fine-tuning, and several fine-tuning methods, such as  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Supervised Finetuning (SFT). We also touch upon the benefits of the Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) approach using Hugging Face's PEFT library, promising both efficiency and performance gains in fine-tuning.</p>"},{"location":"RenamedTask7a/#why-we-finetune-llms","title":"Why We Finetune LLMs","text":"<p>While pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a broad understanding of language, it doesn't equip them with the specialized knowledge needed for complex tasks. For instance, a pre-trained LLM may excel at generating text but encounter difficulties when tasked with sentiment analysis or even providing information from your own Knowledge base. This is where fine-tuning comes into play.</p> <p>Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pretrained model to a specific task by further training it using task-specific data. For example, if we aim to make an LLM proficient in answering questions about Webex Calling or Webex CC, we would fine-tune it using a dataset comprising Webex question-answer pairs. This process enables the model to recalibrate its internal parameters and representations to align with the intended task, enhancing its capacity to address domain-specific challenges effectively.</p> <p>However, fine-tuning LLMs conventionally can be resource-intensive and costly. It involves adjusting  the parameters in the pretrained LLM models, which can number in the billions, necessitating significant computational power and time. Consequently, it's crucial to explore more efficient and cost-effective methods for fine-tuning, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).</p>"},{"location":"RenamedTask7a/#a-reminder-on-instruction-and-conversational-finetuning","title":"A Reminder On Instruction and Conversational Finetuning","text":"<p>In Conversational fine tuning the model engages in a dialogue with the user, maintaining context over multiple turns.The interaction mimics a natural conversation, with the model responding in a way that feels like a human interlocutor.</p> <p>Instruction fine-tuning is a specific type of fine-tuning that grants precise control over a model's behavior.

PEFT leverages architectures that only fine-tune a small number of additional model parameters while freezing most parameters of the pretrained LLMs, significantly reducing computational and storage costs.</p> <p>PEFT methods offer benefits beyond just efficiency. These methods have been proven to outperform standard fine-tuning methods, particularly in low-data situations, and provide improved generalization for out-of-domain scenarios.

approximated_weights).mean()\n</code></pre> * Calculate the absolute difference between the original weights and the approximated weights. * Compute the mean of these differences to get the average quantization error.</p> <p> Step 6:  Print the Result:</p> <p><pre><code>print(f\"Average Quantization Error: {error}\")\n</code></pre> * Print the average quantization error to show the potential loss of accuracy introduced by reducing the bit-width from 32-bit to 4-bit.</p> <p> OUTPUT  </p> <p><code>Average Quantization Error: 0.016423573800129817</code></p> <p> Optional Step  Lets see the original generated randon floating point weights </p> <pre><code>original_weights\n</code></pre> <p><code>0.9047668 , 0.81753767, 0.15176044, 0.82469964, 0.26190883,        0.25543845, 0.91670144,

This technique tackles the issues related to the fine-tuning process, such as extensive memory demands and computational inefficiency. LoRA introduces a compact set of parameters, referred to as low-rank matrices, to store the necessary changes in the model instead of altering all parameters.</p> <p>Here are the key features of how LoRA operates:</p> <ul> <li>Maintaining Pretrained Weights: LoRA adopts a unique strategy by preserving the pretrained weights of the model. This approach reduces the risk of catastrophic forgetting, ensuring the model maintains the valuable knowledge it gained during pretraining.</li> <li>Efficient Rank-Decomposition: LoRA incorporates rank-decomposition weight matrices, known as update matrices, to the existing weights. Rank decomposition is a way to simplify a large, complex matric by breaking it down into the product of smaller matrices. These update matrices have significantly fewer parameters than the original model, making them highly memory-efficient. By training only these newly added weights, LoRA achieves a faster training process with reduced memory demands.
