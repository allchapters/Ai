  <h1>Task 8c - Configuring and Fine Tuning - Using ChatGPT</h1>

<p><img alt="gpt-ft" src="../assets/task8c/gpt-ft.png" /></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Just to summarise fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large language model to a specific task or domain. Although pre-trained language models like GPT possess vast language knowledge, they lack specialization in specific areas e.g specific info about Webex. Fine-tuning addresses this limitation by allowing the model to learn from domain-specific data to make it more accurate and effective for targeted applications.</p>
<p>Having already customized LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3, let's now dive into fine-tuning another AI model GPT4. As we have seen, fine-tuning allows you to adapt a model for specific tasks, enhancing its accuracy and reliability. It can also make your prompts more efficient, saving both time and costs. </p>
<p>In our demo, we’re going to try something different: fine-tuning a language model using synthetic datasets created by a more advanced AI (GPT4).</p>
<p><span class="colour" style="color:orange">Note: it's important to note that fine-tuning this type of model involves some costs. More info for pricing available <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">here</a></span></p>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuning is currently available for the following models: </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="prereq1" src="../assets/task8c/prereq1.png" /></p>
<p><span class="colour" style="color:orange">Note: Fine-tuning for GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613 and gpt-4o-*) is in an experimental access program—eligible users can request access in the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/finetune">fine-tuning UI</a> when creating a new fine-tuning job.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While there is no strict minimum, the quality and quantity of the data greatly affect the fine-tuning process. To fine-tune a GPT model, you are requiorange to provide a dataset with atleast 10 examples </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you start a fine-tuning job, it's crucial to check your dataset's formatting. OpenAI has provided a simple Python script that helps you spot potential errors, review token counts, and estimate the cost of fine-tuning. You can find the code <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/chat_finetuning_data_prep">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="datasets-creation">Datasets Creation</h2>
<p>As we will be using and fine tuning GPT4  model we need to convert datasets into a uniform format. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset">More Info at</a></p>

<li><strong>Trained tokens:</strong> The model was trained on 22,836 tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Epochs:</strong> The fine-tuning process involved 3 epochs, meaning the dataset was cycled through three times.</li>
<li><strong>Batch size:</strong> The batch size was set to 1, indicating that one example was processed at a time during training.</li>
<li><strong>Learning rate (LR) multiplier:</strong> The learning rate multiplier was set to 1.8, which adjusts the learning rate during training.</li>
<li><strong>Seed:</strong> A seed value of 3 was used to create randomness in the training process. Ensuring the reproducibility of the fine-tuning process.</li>
<li><strong>Checkpoints:</strong> The process included checkpoints at steps 62, 124, and the final step, allowing you to save intermediate models during training.</li>
<li><strong>Training loss:</strong> The final training loss achieved was 0.0010, which is a measure of how well the model is fitting the data.</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this session, we've exploorange the capabilities of OpenAI's models and walked through the process of fine-tuning them to enhance their performance for specific tasks. We've also coveorange the key requirements needed to successfully fine-tune a model. Fine-tuning allows us to adjust the language model’s responses, making them more effective at addressing particular tasks, styles, or domains with greater accuracy and efficiency.</p>
<p>Unlike open-source models like LLaMA, Mistral, or Stable Diffusion, where fine-tuning can be more complex, the process for fine-tuning GPT is straightforward, involving simple API calls.</p>
