# Overview - Enabling Hybrid Work with ThousandEyes

Work from the Office. Work from Home. Hybrid work has opened up the possibility of work from wherever the internet is available. At the same time, it brings new challenges to the IT team managing the end host's security, application performance, local network connection, VPN, proxy, and user's total digital experience. ThousandEyes provides this visibility with Endpoint Agents monitoring. In the lab, you will go through guided steps to start monitoring Endpoint hosts.

## Upon completion of this lab you will be able to

* Deploy ThousandEyes Endpoint Agents
* Start monitoring SaaS services
* Learn how to enable Automated Session Testing (AST)
* Configure browser session monitoring
* Use the collected data for live troubleshooting
* Create a snapshot to share with others for colloboration
* Create/Duplicate a [Hybrid/Remote Worker Dashboard](https://www.thousandeyes.com/blog/best-practices-create-remote-workforce-dashboard)
